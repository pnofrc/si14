# Future


At a higher stage, **everyone will become an artist**, i.e., inseparably a producer-consumer of total culture creation, which will help the rapid dissolution of the linear criteria of novelty. Everyone will be a situationist so to speak, with a **multidimensional inflation of tendencies, experiences, or radically different "schools" - not successively, but simultaneously.**

We will inaugurate what will historically be the last of the crafts. The role of amateur-professional situationist - of anti-specialist - is **again a specialisation up to the point of economic and mental abundance**, when everyone becomes an "artist," in the sense that the artists have not attained the construction of their own life. However, the last craft of history is so close to the society without a permanent division of labour, that when it appeared amongst the S.I., its status as a craft was generally denied.

## building a future

To those who don't understand us properly, we say with an irreducible scorn: "The situationists of which you believe yourselves perhaps to be the judges, will one day judge you. We await the turning point which is the inevitable liquidation of the world of privation, in all its forms. Such are our goals, and these will be [[the future goals of humanity]]."
